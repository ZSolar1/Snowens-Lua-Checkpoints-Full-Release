# Snowens Lua Checkpoints, Full Release! (V1)
## [CREDITS]
Snowen/sn0wenx: half-Save data functionality (It was very broken, I(ZSolarDev) had to spend so long fixing it :<)

ZSolarDev/zsolar1: "min:sec" to millisecond converter(and vise versa), custom checkpoint sprite,
health tweening, script customization(wrote all of this, took over a day :/), checkpoint functionality,
checkpoint hit effect customization

BlueColorsin: getColor function

I(ZSolarDev) appreciate all of the help that I got to work on this. Thank you Snowen and BlueColorsin, I appreciate it. :D
## [WHATS PLANNED]
(When I or Me is said in this section, its reffering to ZSolarDev.)
Me and Snowen plan to make it so that the timebar resets every time you reach a checkpoint. I want to change it a bit though, because some
people will obvoiusly still want the og timebar. I think we could have a bar next to the timebar that fills up slowly until a checkpoint is reached, and
will say how much time is left till the next checkpoint is reached. It will be fill all the way up be the time a checkpoint is reached, and then reset
until the next checkpoint. Maybe we could make this bar customizable.

Please send Suggestions where this script is posted!
## [IF YOU NEED HELP]
Please contact ZSolarDev(zsolar1) at the page where this script is posted. The pages this script is posted will contain some sort of methed
to talk to ZSolarDev(such as comments or talking in the discussion post in the Psych Ward.)
## [FEATURES]
1. checkpoints (obviously)
2. The ability to alter the image that shows up/sound that plays when a checkpoint is hit.
3. You can make a custom checkpoint hit effect if you dont want an image (requires lua scripting knoledge).
4. Ability to reset health when a checkpoint is hit.
5. A screen at the start of your song asking if the player wants to wipe all of their checkpoints.
6. A debug mode if you want to snoop around the script a bit (The checkpoint reset screen is enabled by default if debug mode is on)
  
   Features 2-6 are customizable with instructions in the script itself!
